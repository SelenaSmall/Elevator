##This class will co-ordinate all floors and elevator to move efficiently

#	def move_lift
#		puts "Press 1 to move lift up, Press 2 to move lift down\n"
#		answer = gets.chomp.to_i
			
#			if answer == 1
#				puts "Lift moving up\n"

#Does lift exist?
#Where is lift currently?

#lift ascend to highest level called (not above level 7)
#stop at all levels which are higher than the current level AND that
#have called to go to a higher level. ALSO
#stop at all stops which are higher than the current level AND that
#have been called AND that are higher than the level which first 
#called them

#if no level (greater than the current level) has called to go to 
#a higher level then{

	
#lift descend to lowest level called (not below 1)
#stop at all levels which are lower than the current level AND that
#have called to go to a lower level. ALSO
#stop at all stops which are lower than the current level AND that 
#have been called AND that are lower than the level which first 
#called them}

###its not until the user is actually in the lift that they decide where they want to go to ;p
